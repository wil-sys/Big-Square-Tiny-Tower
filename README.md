# Big-Square-Tiny-Tower

A Big Tower Tiny Square fan game made by William Mulreed (Last Nanosecond productions) with permission from Russ Dawson (Evil Objective).
This game is very much a work in progress and, as of the 11-29-23_1 build features placeholder menus and only 1 movement demonstration level.
This game is fully written in Unity 2022 LTS, and is compiled to WebGL/HTML5 (It even runs on mobile).
Current features in development are: the big square, checkpoints/portals, and saws.
Planned features are: Turrets, A storyline, and an in-game level editor.
